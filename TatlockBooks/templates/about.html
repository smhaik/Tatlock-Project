		"The HDW promotes the university's activities in both of its basic vectors: in research, by facilitating projects that require or benefit from data collection and analysis, or electronic publication; in teaching, by bringing students into the research process in concrete ways that can be rare in the humanities. (It's one of the happy facts about digital projects that they're often intensely collaborative.)"
